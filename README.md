### **What is CANO?**

CANO, or Close Access Network Operations, is a method for gaining access to closed wireless networks by exploiting the WPA2 authentication process. It involves using a Raspberry Pi equipped with two Alpha Wi-Fi cards, one to monitor and another to transmit.

Raspberry Pi connects to a server via a cellular modem using WireGuard VPN, allowing an operator to manage the device. CANO encompasses both the technical tools deployed on the Raspberry Pi and the setup used by the end user to control and interact with it.

### **What is the Wirless Exploit?**

There isn't a single name for this exploit, but what is, is a **WPA2 Deauth + Handshake Capture Attack**

You send a deauthentication frame to forcibly disconnect a client from the access point. When the client reconnects, it performs a four-way handshake with the AP. You can capture this handshake, which contains a hash of the pre-shared key.

So the exploit isn’t breaking WPA2 directly, it's exploiting the unprotected nature of management frames and the fact that the handshake exposes a hash that can be attacked offline.

### **Why is CANO needed?**

CANO is needed because many high-value or adversarial networks are air-gapped or closed. These networks are often used in sensitive environments, such as forward operating bases, research facilities, or command centers, where standard remote cyber operations simply won’t work.

CANO enables operatives to gain access to those networks through physical proximity or wireless vulnerabilities, and then remotely manage implanted devices using covert communication channels like cellular modems and encrypted VPN tunnels. 

It allows for persistent access, remote command and control, and operational flexibility without risking attribution. In essence, it extends cyber capabilities into non-traditional, physically isolated environments, which is essential for reconnaissance, surveillance, and offensive cyber effects in the field.

### **Has CANO been useful?**

One notable [example](https://irp.fas.org/doddir/army/fm3-12.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is the 2018 incident involving Russian military intelligence officers (GRU) who were caught attempting to hack into the Wi-Fi network of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague. The operatives were discovered with specialized equipment designed to intercept wireless communications, highlighting the risks and methods associated with close-proximity cyber operations.

In response to such exposures, adversaries have adapted their tactics. By 2022, GRU hackers developed a technique known as the "nearest neighbor attack," where they compromised a device on a nearby network and used it as a relay to access the target's Wi-Fi network. This method allowed them to conduct operations without being physically close to the target, reducing the risk of detection.
